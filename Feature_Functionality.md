Here's a detailed step-by-step process for the AI-powered health monitoring system you're building, including blood and organ donation features:

### Step-by-Step Feature Implementation

---

### 1\. **User Registration & Authentication**

- **Login/Registration Page**:
  - Allow users to register using their email, phone number, and a password.
  - Add an option for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
  - Include two checkboxes for "Available for Blood Donation" and "Available for Organ Donation."
  - Required fields: Email, Phone Number, Age, Gender, Blood Group.

### 2\. **User Profile Setup**

- **Profile Page**:
  - After registration, users will be directed to a profile page where they can fill in more details like medical history, current medications, allergies, etc.
  - Fields like blood type and whether they're willing to donate blood or organs will be collected.
  - Users can update their information at any time. Profile settings should include the ability to turn on/off notifications for donation-related events.
  - **Rewards Section**: Introduce a reward system where users can accumulate points for participating in donations. Once they accumulate enough points, they can redeem them for vouchers at medical stores.

### 3\. **Home Screen with Animated Donation Selector**

- **Animated Transition Page**:
  - Use a gesture-based navigation system (swipe or click) for transitioning between "Blood Donation" and "Organ Donation" screens.
  - Background changes color (red for blood donation, blue for organ donation) to make the user interface more engaging.

- **Nearby Donation Camps**:

  - Use geolocation to list camps closest to the user and allow them to sign up for participation.
  - Add a "Navigate to Map" button for event location.

### 5\. **Organ Donation Module**

- Similar to the blood donation module, include the organ donation process.
- **Educational Materials**:
  - Provide documents or videos on the benefits, myths, and preparation for organ donation.
  - Include checklists for potential organ donors regarding eligibility and the legal process.

### 7\. **Chatbot for Assistance**

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**:
